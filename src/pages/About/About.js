                  When founders Siyam remodeled their home, they started the way
                  these projects often do: with a tall stack of magazines and
                  referrals for home professionals from people they knew. But
                  after those piles of torn out pages failed to make their dream
                  a reality, they felt stuck. There had to be a better way.

                  refunded the price of the product and applicable sales tax.
